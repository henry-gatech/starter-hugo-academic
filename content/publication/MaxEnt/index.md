abstract: "The matrix completion problem, which aims to recover a low-rank
  matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ from partial, noisy observations of its entries, arises
  in many machine learning applications. In this work, we present a novel
  information-theoretic framework for initial and sequential sampling of matrix
  entries for noisy matrix completion, based on the maximum entropy sampling
  principle in \\citet{SW1987}. The key novelty in our approach is that it makes
  use of uncertainty quantification (UQ) -- a measure of uncertainty for
  unobserved entries -- to guide the sampling procedure. Our framework reveals
  new insights on the role of coherence and coding design on sampling for matrix
  completion. "
