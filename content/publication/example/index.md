abstract: We consider the problem of uncertainty quantification for an unknown
  low-rank matrix X, given a partial and noisy observation of its entries. This
  quantification of uncertainty is essential for many real-world problems,
  including image processing, satellite imaging, and seismology, providing a
  principled framework for validating scientific conclusions and guiding
  decision-making. However, existing literature has largely focused on the
  completion (i.e., point estimation) of the matrix X, with little work on
  investigating its uncertainty. To this end, we propose in this work a new
  Bayesian modeling framework, called BayeSMG, which parametrizes the unknown X
  via its underlying row and column subspaces. This Bayesian subspace
  parametrization allows for efficient posterior inference on matrix subspaces,
  which represents interpretable phenomena in many applications. This can then
  be leveraged for improved matrix recovery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
  BayeSMG over existing Bayesian matrix recovery methods in numerical
  experiments and a seismic sensor network application.
