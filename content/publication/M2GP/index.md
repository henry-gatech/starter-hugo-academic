abstract: In an era where scientific experimentation is often costly,
  multi-fidelity emulation provides a powerful tool for predictive scientific
  computing. While there has been notable work on multi-fidelity modeling,
  existing models do not incorporate an important multi-stage property of
  multi-fidelity simulators, where multiple fidelity parameters control for
  accuracy at different experimental stages. Such multi-stage simulators are
  widely encountered in complex nuclear physics and astrophysics problems. We
  thus propose a new Multi-stage Multi-fidelity Gaussian Process (M2GP) model,
  which embeds this multi-stage structure within a novel non-stationary
  covariance function. We show that the M2GP model can capture prior knowledge
  on the numerical convergence of multi-stage simulators, which allows for
  cost-efficient emulation of multi-fidelity systems. We demonstrate the
  improved predictive performance of the M2GP model over state-of-the-art
  methods in a suite of numerical experiments and two applications, the first
  for emulation of cantilever beam deflection and the second for emulating the
  evolution of the quark-gluon plasma, which was theorized to have filled the
  Universe shortly after the Big Bang.
