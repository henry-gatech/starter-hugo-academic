abstract: |-
  We present a novel adversarial detector for the anomalous sequence
  when there are only one-class training samples. The
  detector is developed by finding the best detector that can
  discriminate against the worst-case, which statistically mimics
  the training sequences. We explicitly capture the dependence
  in sequential events using the marked point process
  with a deep Fourier kernel. The detector evaluates a test sequence
  and compares it with an optimal time-varying threshold,
  which is also learned from data. Using numerical experiments
  on simulations and real-world datasets, we demonstrate
  the superior performance of our proposed method.
