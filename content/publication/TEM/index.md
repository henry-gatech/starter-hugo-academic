abstract: Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is a powerful tool for imaging
  material structure and characterizing material chemistry. Recent advances in
  data collection technology for TEM have enabled high-volume and
  high-resolution data collection at a microsecond frame rate. Taking advantage
  of these advances in data collection rates requires the development and
  application of data processing tools, including image analysis, feature
  extraction, and streaming data processing techniques. In this paper, we
  highlight a few areas in materials science that have benefited from combining
  signal processing and statistical analysis with data collection capabilities
  in TEM and present a future outlook on opportunities of integrating signal
  processing with automated TEM data analysis.
