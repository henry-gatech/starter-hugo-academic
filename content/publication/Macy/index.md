  Spatio-temporal event data are becoming increasingly commonplace in a wide
  variety of applications, such as electronic transaction records, social
  network data, and crime incident reports. How to efficiently detect anomalies
  in these dynamic

  systems using these streaming event data? This work proposes

  a novel anomaly detection framework for such event

  data combining the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and

  marked spatio-temporal point processes. The detection procedure

  can be computed in an online and distributed fashion

  via feeding the streaming data through an LSTM and a neural

  network-based discriminator. This work studies the falsealarm-

  rate and detection delay using theory and simulation

  and shows that it can achieve weak signal detection by aggregating

  local statistics over time and networks. Finally, we

  demonstrate the good performance using real-world data sets.
