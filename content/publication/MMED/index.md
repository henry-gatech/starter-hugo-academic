abstract: The numerical accuracy of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) depends on the
  number of finite elements used in the discretization of the space, which can
  be varied using the mesh size. The larger the number of elements, the more
  accurate the results are. However, the computational cost increases with the
  number of elements. In current practice, the experimenter chooses a mesh size
  that is expected to produce a reasonably accurate result, and for which the
  computer simulation can be completed in a reasonable amount of time.
  Improvements to this approach have been proposed using multi-fidelity modeling
  by choosing two or three mesh sizes. However, mesh size is a continuous
  parameter and therefore, multi-fidelity simulations can be performed easily by
  choosing a different value for the mesh size for each of the simulations. In
  this article, we develop a method to optimally find the mesh sizes for each
  simulation and satisfy the same time constraints as a single or double mesh
  size experiment. A range of different mesh sizes used in the proposed method
  allows one to fit multi-fidelity models more reliably and predict the outcome
  when meshes approach infinitesimally small, which is impossible to achieve in
  actual simulations. We illustrate our approach using an analytical function
  and a cantilever beam finite element analysis experiment.
