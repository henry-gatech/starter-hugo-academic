abstract: This article proposes new modeling methods for deterministic computer
  experiments with multiple tuning parameters. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is
  commonly applied in large-scale computer experiments. Therefore, tuning
  parameters which control the mesh densities of the simulation are critical to
  its accuracy. This work utilizes a non-stationary Gaussian process model to
  bring together simulations of different mesh densities and improve the overall
  prediction performance. It looks at the case where there are more than one
  mesh density variables, which has not been investigated before. We apply the
  proposed method to an analytical function, and a stress analysis application
  for a beam cantilever structure.
