It has been a great opportunity for me to have given two invited talks at 2021 INFORMS annual meeting over the past few days.

At the invited talk at the 1st INFORMS Workshop on Quality, Statistics & Reliability, I discussed our work on uncertainty quantification for low-rank matrix completion.

At the invited talk at the session for Machine Learning for Spatio-temporal Data Modeling and Analysis, I talked about our work on Adversarial Anomaly Detection For Marked Spatio-Temporal Data.
