I am glad to have been given the opportunity to present three of our recent works at the QSR workshop at 2022 INFORMS annual meeting.

1. Design and analysis for multi-fidelity finite element simulations.
2. Sequential Bayesian low-rank matrix data assimilation.
3. Multi-stage multi-fidelity Gaussian process modeling and design, with application to emulation of heavy-ion collisions.
